# slack-etiquette

1. Use `@here` and `@channel` with caution; especiallyl in large rooms like `#general`.

2. Invite people to a channel with `/invite @user`, not `@` mentioning them in chat.

Mentioning someone adds to the chat log an unnecessarily adds an unread message or notifies members of that activity.
Using `/invite` won't notify everyone, which is a good thing.

3. Don't start a message with "Hey" or similar.

After typing "hey", press ". " and keep typing your message instead of just pressing enter.  As a reciever, getting the message "hey" distracts you from your work without meaning.

4. Use email for topics that warrant long-form discussion.

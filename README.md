# slack-etiquette

## 1. Use `@here` and `@channel` sparingly. Avoid them completely in large rooms like `#general`.

Does your message really need to notify everyone immediately? Probably not, unless it's an emergency.

Otherwise, maybe an email is more appropriate.

## 2. Invite people to a channel with `/invite @user`, not `@` mentioning them in chat.

Mentioning someone adds to the chat log an unnecessarily adds an unread message or notifies members of that activity.
Using `/invite` won't notify everyone, which is a good thing.

## 3. Don't start a message with "Hey" or similar.

After typing "hey", press ". " and keep typing your message instead of just pressing enter.  As a reciever, getting the message "hey" distracts you from your work without meaning.

## 4. Use email for topics that warrant long-form discussion.
